    "text": "I’m a PhD candidate at SUNY-ESF, working on predictive modeling and visualization with a focus on natural systems. My current work focuses on using game engines as GIS to visualize large-scale landscapes with a focus on forested systems as a method for scientific communication and outreach. Past projects have focused on landscape and community ecology, and have included predictive models of forest biomass from remote sensing data and the landscape-level impacts of beaver within New York’s Adirondack State Park. In all of these projects I’ve worked to apply data science techniques to large-scale challenges, frequently serving as the statistical and technical expert within my team.\nOn this site I keep a list of my publications, presentations, and my CV, as well as a technical blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunifir: A Unifying API for Interacting with Unity from R.
