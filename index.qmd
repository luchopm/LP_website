## Bio

Recently graduated from St. Clair College,  City of Windsor, Ontario, Canada on Data Analytics for Business program.

I have more than 11 years of experience in large organizations, as part of the regional office, working in Financial data analysis, Financial reporting, and BI development.

In addition, I combined my work with my IT background in BI (Business Intelligence) development, creating executive and affordable financial and operational dashboards. 

On this site I keep updated my curriculum, and [my CV](cv.pdf), as well you can reach my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lmpalacios).
